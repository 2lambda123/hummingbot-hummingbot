# Release Notes - Version 0.6.0

üöÄWelcome to `hummingbot` version 0.6.0! This release, we focused on making it easier for you to generate profits with Hummingbot. Highlights include improved resilience against network connection issues and exchange anamolies, the new `discovery` strategy that helps you discover trading opportunities, exchange-specific transaction costs incorporated into all strategies, the new `history` command that helps you analyze performance, and a stop loss switch!

## üí∏ Cross-exchange market making strategy now incorporates exchange-specific transaction costs

In the last release, we incorporated exchange-specific transaction costs like trading commissions and gas costs (for decentralized exchanges) into Hummingbot's decision model. This means that you can set a `min_profitability` that ignores transaction costs, and Hummingbot will only make and take orders that it expects to be profitable after factoring in transaction costs.

## New strategy: `discovery`




## New CLI command: `history`

## Stop loss switch

## Improved network reliability


## üêû Bug fixes and miscellaneous updates
* Fixed a bug with the `status` outut of the arbitrage strategy
* Fixed a bug in which duplicate orders may appear on DDEX. We have discovered an issue with the DDEX API and are working with them to isolate and rectify the bug.

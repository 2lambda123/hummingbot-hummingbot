# Release Notes - Version 0.7.0

🚀Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.7.0! In release, we focused on improving core stability and fixing bugs. In addition, we're happy to announce a new market making strategy as well as our first 3rd party exchange connector! 

Please see below for more details.

## 🤖 New strategy: pure market making

We have added the first version of a [pure market making strategy](/strategies/pure-market-making/), so all three strategies described in our [whitepaper](/whitepaper/) have now been released into production.

Please note that this initial release contains a naive implementation that simply sets and maintains a constant spread around a trading pair's mid price. **Note that this is intended to be a basic template that users can test and customize. Running the strategy with substantial capital without additional modifications will likely lose money**.

Over the next few releases, we will add additional functionality that allows users of this strategy to incorporate important factors such as inventory level and market volatility.

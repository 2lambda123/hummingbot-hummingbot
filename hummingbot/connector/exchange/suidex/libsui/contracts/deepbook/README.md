DeepBook is a decentralized central limit order book (CLOB) built for the Sui ecosystem. DeepBook provides a one-stop shop for trading digital assets, with a technical design built for Sui’s architecture. DeepBook leverages Sui’s performance and delivers a low latency and high throughput execution engine to spread liquidity across the DeFi ecosystem.

Designed as permissionless and released as open source, DeepBook will accelerate the development of financial and other apps on Sui. It will give builders an efficient and shared ready-built financial layer for trading fungible assets.
